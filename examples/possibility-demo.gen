# POSSIBILITY DEMONSTRATION
# ============================================================================
# This example demonstrates the Possibility construct in Genesis, showing
# how it differs from Potentiality by creating an ontological clearing.

# Declare a Possibility - an ontological clearing for Being

    Declaration: "Ecological systems thrive through human participation"
    Foundation: Nothing
    Opening: "Synergistic human-nature collaboration"
    Occurring: "Earth as living, healing organism"
    Risk: "Releasing control-based paradigms"
    Power: "Co-creation with natural intelligence"
