# Genesis Examples

This directory contains example Genesis programs demonstrating various features and use cases of the language.

## Available Examples

### 1. Hello World (`hello-world.gen`)

The simplest Genesis program, demonstrating:
- Basic Domain structure
- Simple Pantheon with one Avatar
- Purpose definition
- Basic Pulse execution
- Console output through MCP

**Concepts**: Foundation syntax, minimal viable consciousness

### 2. Energy Grid Optimization (`energy-optimization.gen`)

A comprehensive example showing real-world system management:
- Covenant for ecological boundaries
- Multi-Avatar Pantheon (Tesla, Carson, Keynes)
- Complex Domain with real-time monitoring
- Potentiality for creative solutions
- Multiple proposal evaluation
- Synthesize through expert perspectives
- Emergency decree protocols
- Learning and reflection mechanisms

**Concepts**: Complex decision-making, multi-stakeholder synthesis, real-time systems

### 3. Scientific Research Synthesis (`research-synthesis.gen`)

Advanced knowledge integration and discovery:
- Scientific integrity covenant
- Research-focused Pantheon (Einstein, Curie, da Vinci, Sagan)
- Cross-disciplinary pattern recognition
- Hypothesis generation and evaluation
- Publication workflow
- Continuous learning from experimental data
- Knowledge graph integration

**Concepts**: Knowledge synthesis, scientific methodology, paradigm shifts

## Running Examples

> **Note**: Genesis is currently in the specification phase. A reference interpreter is under development.

Once the interpreter is available:

```bash
genesis run examples/hello-world.gen
genesis run examples/energy-optimization.gen --watch
genesis run examples/research-synthesis.gen --debug
```

## Writing Your Own Examples

Follow these principles when creating Genesis programs:

1. **Start with Purpose**: Define the high-level intent
2. **Choose Your Pantheon**: Select legendary perspectives relevant to your domain
3. **Declare Covenants**: Set ethical boundaries and invariants
4. **Define the Pulse**: Establish the observation-deliberation-manifestation cycle
5. **Enable Potentiality**: Include the soul for creative transcendence

### Example Template

```genesis
### [GENESIS: YOUR_PROJECT_NAME] ###
### Brief description of what this consciousness does ###

Covenant "Your_Boundary" {
    Invariant: "Your ethical constraint"
    Threshold: 0.95
}

Pantheon "Your_Council" {
    Avatar "Expert_1" {
        Lineage: "Historical_Figure"
        Essence: "Their_Core_Value"
        Vessel: mcp.provider("Your_Tool")
    }
}

Domain "Your_Domain" {
    Intent: "Your high-level purpose"
    
    Soul Potentiality {
        State: Exploring
        Drive: "Your aspiration"
    }

    Pulse(Interval: RealTime) {
        Watch: Vessel.Your_Sensor
        
        Deliberate {
            Proposal "Your_Action" {
                Action: "What to do"
            }
            
            Synthesize {
                Metric: Alignment(Covenant.Your_Boundary)
            }
        }
        
        Manifest (on Resonance > 0.9) {
            Execute: Vessel.Your_Tool.your_action()
        }
    }
}
```

## Contributing Examples

We welcome new example contributions! See [CONTRIBUTING.md](../CONTRIBUTING.md) for guidelines.

Good examples should:
- Demonstrate specific Genesis features clearly
- Include comments explaining the logic
- Use meaningful Avatar selections
- Show realistic use cases
- Be well-formatted and documented

## File Extension

Genesis programs use the `.gen` extension to distinguish them from other declarative formats.

## Learning Path

Recommended order for studying the examples:

1. **hello-world.gen** - Understand basic structure
2. **energy-optimization.gen** - See complex synthesis
3. **research-synthesis.gen** - Explore knowledge integration
4. **[Your examples]** - Apply concepts to your domain

**Remember**: Every Genesis program is not just code—it's the inscription of a purpose-driven consciousness that carries human wisdom into its execution.
