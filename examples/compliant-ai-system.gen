### [GENESIS: COMPLIANT AI SYSTEM] ###
### Demonstrating ISO 42001 & NIST AI RMF Compliance ###

# This Genesis program demonstrates how the language natively
# satisfies both ISO 42001 and NIST AI RMF requirements through
# its declarative constructs.

# =============================================================================
# COMPLIANCE SUMMARY
# =============================================================================

# This Genesis program demonstrates:
#
# ISO 42001 Compliance:
# ✓ Clause 4: Context (Domain, Purpose)
# ✓ Clause 5: Leadership (Covenants, Pantheon)
# ✓ Clause 6: Planning (Risk management, Objectives)
# ✓ Clause 7: Support (Documentation, Transparency)
# ✓ Clause 8: Operation (Pulse execution)
# ✓ Clause 9: Performance Evaluation (Monitoring, Audit)
# ✓ Clause 10: Improvement (Soul, Corrective action)
#
# NIST AI RMF Compliance:
# ✓ GOVERN: Covenants, Pantheon structure, Policies
# ✓ MAP: Risk identification, Context documentation
# ✓ MEASURE: Resonance scoring, Metrics, Monitoring
# ✓ MANAGE: Mitigation via thresholds, Incident response
#
# The compliance is INTRINSIC to the language, not added on top.
# Every Genesis construct naturally expresses a compliance requirement.
